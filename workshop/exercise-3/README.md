# Exercise 3 - Deploy the BookInfo app in to the mesh

The BookInfo app is a sample app for users to leave comments. It consists of a web front end, Redis master for storage, and a replicated set of Redis slaves. We will also integrate the app with Watson Tone Analyzer which detects the sentiment in users' comments and replies with emoticons.

### Enable the automatic sidecar injection for the bookinfo namespace
In Kubernetes, a sidecar is a utility container in the pod, and its purpose is to support the main container. For Istio to work, Envoy proxies must be deployed as sidecars to each pod of the deployment. There are two ways of injecting the Istio sidecar into a pod: manually using the istioctl CLI tool or automatically using the Istio sidecar injector. In this exercise, we will use the automatic sidecar injection provided by Istio.

1.  Create a project called "bookinfo"
    ``` shell
    oc new-project bookinfo
    ```

2.  Annotate the bookinfo namespace to enable automatic sidecar injection:
    
    ``` shell
    oc label namespace bookinfo istio-injection=enabled
    ```
    
3.  Validate the namespace is annotated for automatic sidecar injection:
    
    ``` shell
    oc get namespace -L istio-injection
    ```
    
    Sample output:
    ``` shell
    NAME             STATUS   AGE    ISTIO-INJECTION
    bookinfo          Active   271d   enabled
    istio-system     Active   5d2h
    ...
    ```

## Install the BookInfo app

1. Inject the Istio Envoy sidecar into the bookinfo pods, and deploy the BookInfo app on to the Kubernetes cluster. Deploy both the v1 and v2 versions of the app:

    ```shell
    oc apply -f bookinfo/bookinfo.yaml
    ```

These commands deploy the BookInfo app on to the cluster. Since we enabled automation sidecar injection, these pods will be also include an Envoy sidecar as they are started in the cluster. Here we have two versions of deployments, a new version (`v2`) in the current directory, and a previous version (`v1`) in a sibling directory. They will be used in future sections to showcase the Istio traffic routing capabilities.

1. Verify that the pods are up and running.

    ```shell
    oc get pods
    ```
    Sample output:
    ```shell
    NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    details-v1-789c5f58f4-9twtw       2/2       Running   0          4m12s
    productpage-v1-856c8cc5d8-xcx2q   2/2       Running   0          4m11s
    ratings-v1-5786768978-tr8z9       2/2       Running   0          4m12s
    reviews-v1-5874566865-mxfgm       2/2       Running   0          4m12s
    reviews-v2-86865fc7d9-mf6t4       2/2       Running   0          4m12s
    reviews-v3-8d4cbbbbf-rfjcz        2/2       Running   0          4m12s
    ```

    Note that each bookinfo pods has 2 containers in it. One is the bookinfo container, and the other is the Envoy proxy sidecar.

Your bookinfo app is running, but you can't access it! In the next exercise you will expose the productpage service to allow incoming traffic.
